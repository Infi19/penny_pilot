## 🧠 AI & ML Systems

### Unified Assistant
The app uses a single chat interface (`AIAssistantScreen`) that dynamically switches system prompts based on user intent, providing a seamless experience whether you're asking about budget advice or checking a suspicious message.

### Scam Detection Model
A custom TFLite model is embedded in the app to classify SMS messages as Safe, Suspicious, or High Risk. This runs entirely offline for privacy and speed.

## 🔒 Security

This app uses Firebase App Check to prevent unauthorized access to backend resources. In production, ensure you have configured:
- SHA-256 fingerprints in Firebase Console
- Google Play Integrity API for Android
